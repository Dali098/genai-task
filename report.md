# Generative AI Applications — Report

## Intro
I picked a few simple GenAI use cases that people actually use every day: translation, summarizing long texts, and generating images for social media. Nothing too technical. Just how these tools help and where they still fail sometimes.

## 1. AI Translation Tools (DeepL, Google, etc.)

### Business value
- super fast way to translate text (emails, docs, chats)
- good for companies that work with international clients
- saves time for people who don’t know the language well

### Technical challenges
* handling context (esp. slang / idioms)
* keeping translations consistent in long texts  
* training needs huge multilingual datasets  
* style/tone is not always easy to match

### Weak points
- sometimes the output sounds “machine-like”
- tone can be wrong  
- mistakes appear in technical or legal texts  
- small details can get lost

### Existing tools
- **DeepL** — usually gives the most natural-sounding translations  
- **Google Translate** — good coverage of languages, quick results  
- **ChatGPT / Gemini** — can translate + rewrite the text with a tone/style

## 2. Document Summarization (long articles, PDFs, etc.)

### Business value
A lot of people don’t have time to read long documents. Summaries help cut reading time and still understand the main point. Teams can go through reports, meeting notes, and articles faster.

### Technical challenges
- not easy to pick the “important” parts of a text  
- AI sometimes shortens too much  
- numeric data or dates may get changed  
- if the doc jumps between topics, summaries get messy

### Weak points
* can be too general  
* misses details that matter for a specific task  
* sometimes slightly inaccurate  
* depends a lot on how clean the original text is

### Existing tools
- **ChatGPT** — works for articles, PDFs, emails  
- **Claude** — handles long documents pretty well  
- **Notion AI** — comfy for team notes/workspace stuff

## 3. Image Generation for Social Media

### Business value
People want visuals fast (posts, ads, stories). AI images help creators who don’t have design experience or who need quick mockups. Businesses save money on photoshoots and simple graphics.

### Technical challenges
- models need huge image datasets  
- sometimes produce weird anatomy / hands  
- generating text inside images is still bad  
- copyright concerns (similar images, style copying)

### Weak points
* some images look “too AI”  
* random artifacts  
* need several prompts before getting a good result  
* not always predictable (same prompt → different result)

### Existing tools
- **DALL·E 3** - clean and detailed images  
- **Midjourney** - more artistic look, popular for Instagram-style posts  
- **Canva AI** - simple to use, already inside templates

## Conclusion
GenAI tools make basic digital tasks faster: translating stuff, reading less, and creating visuals without design skills. They’re not perfect, but they’re already useful for everyday work and definitely improving over time.
